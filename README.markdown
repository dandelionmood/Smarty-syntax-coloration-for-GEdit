Smarty syntax coloration for GEdit
==================================

What ?
------

This repository contains the files needed to get a Smarty syntax coloration file for GEdit (`smarty.lang`). You can also find a `smarty.xml` that your system will need to associate the `*.tpl` extension to the syntax file. 

How ?
-----

You can use the installation script (`install.sh`) that will put both the `smarty.lang` and `smarty.xml` files at the right place (_no administrator privileges_ needed, everything will be installed in your home folder).

Who ?

I'm *not* the original author of that file I actually [found here (french)](http://www.siteduzero.com/forum-83-594694-p1-utilisez-gedit-pour-vos-projets-utilisant-smarty.html). So thank you __antoyo__ for your work :) ! 

I'm maintaining this repository and will add a few improvements over time to make the syntax file compatible with Smarty 3, so stay tuned !

Why ?
-----

I decided to create this repository because I had a hard time finding it the first time, I hope this will help others as much as it helped me.
