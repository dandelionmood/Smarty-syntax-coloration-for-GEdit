Smarty syntax coloration for GEdit
==================================

What ?
------

This repository contains the files needed to get a Smarty syntax coloration file for GEdit (smarty.lang).

You can use the installation file that will put the `smarty.lang` file at the right place (no administrator privileges needed).

I'm *not* the original author of that file I actually [found here (french)](http://www.siteduzero.com/forum-83-594694-p1-utilisez-gedit-pour-vos-projets-utilisant-smarty.html). So thank you __antoyo__ for your work :) ! 

I'm planning to enrich the `smarty.lang` coloration syntax file with the new keywords found in Smarty 3, so stay tuned ;) ! 

Why ?
-----

I decided to create this repository because I had a hard time finding it the first time, I hope this will help others as much as it helped me.
